-### What *Not* to Contribute
-
-Our lessons already contain more material than we can cover in a typical
-workshop, so we are usually *not* looking for more concepts or tools to add to
-them. As a rule, if you want to introduce a new idea, you must (a) estimate how
-long it will take to teach and (b) explain what you would take out to make room
-for it. The first encourages contributors to be honest about requirements; the
-second, to think hard about priorities.

-We are also not looking for exercises or other material that only run on one
-platform. Our workshops typically contain a mixture of Windows, macOS, and
-Linux users; in order to be usable, our lessons must run equally well on all
-three.
